## 🏠 Overview

**TintSpace** is an innovative iOS AR application that solves one of the most common dilemmas in home decoration: **"How will this paint color actually look on my walls?"**

Instead of buying expensive sample pots or relying on small color swatches, TintSpace uses augmented reality to visualize paint colors directly on your walls in real-time, with realistic lighting and textures.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Real-time wall detection** using ARKit's advanced plane detection
- 🌈 **Instant color visualization** on detected walls with accurate lighting adaptation
- 🖌️ **Multiple finish options** (Matte, Eggshell, Satin, Semi-Gloss, Gloss)
- 📊 **Side-by-side comparison** of different colors on different walls
- 🧩 **Intelligent color harmony suggestions** based on color theory
- 💾 **Save and organize favorite colors** for future reference
- 📱 **Share visualizations** directly from the app
- 🔄 **Undo/Redo support** for quick color experimentation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Swift** & **SwiftUI** - Modern declarative UI framework
- **ARKit** - Apple's augmented reality framework
- **RealityKit** - 3D rendering and physics engine
- **SceneKit** - Advanced 3D visualization
- **Combine** - Reactive programming framework
- **MVVM Architecture** - Clean, maintainable code structure

## 🚀 Technical Highlights

### 🧠 Advanced AR Wall Detection

TintSpace uses ARKit's vertical plane detection with custom enhancements to identify and track walls in your environment with high precision. Our algorithm can:

- Identify and categorize vertical surfaces
- Distinguish between walls and other vertical objects
- Handle partially obscured walls (e.g., furniture placement)
- Provide real-time updates as new surfaces come into view

### 🎭 Realistic Paint Simulation

Unlike simple color overlays, TintSpace simulates how paint actually looks on walls:

- Real-time light adaptation based on room lighting conditions
- Accurate representation of different paint finishes (from flat matte to high gloss)
- Surface texture preservation for realistic appearance
- Edge detection for clean color application

### 🎯 Intelligent User Guidance System

TintSpace features a sophisticated contextual guidance system:

- Real-time status notifications for AR session state
- Contextual tutorials based on user interaction
- Automatic detection of suboptimal conditions (low light, excessive movement)
- Progressive disclosure of advanced features

### 🧪 Color Theory Implementation

Our color harmony engine incorporates established color theory principles:

- Complementary color suggestions
- Analogous color palettes
- Monochromatic variations
- Split-complementary options
- Curated color collections from leading paint brands

## 🔮 How It Works

1. **Point your camera at a wall** - TintSpace automatically detects vertical surfaces
2. **Tap to select a wall** - Selected walls are highlighted for clear visibility
3. **Choose a color** - Select from curated palettes or create custom colors
4. **Experiment with finishes** - See how different sheens affect the appearance
5. **Compare and share** - Apply different colors to different walls and share the results

## 📱 User Experience Focus

TintSpace is designed with a strong focus on user experience:

- **Minimal learning curve** - Intuitive gestures and clear visual feedback
- **Contextual guidance** - Just-in-time instructions based on what you're doing
- **Performance optimization** - Smooth AR experience even on older devices
- **Accessibility support** - Voice-over compatible with appropriate contrast ratios
- **Offline functionality** - No internet connection required for core features

## 🔧 Installation

TintSpace requires iOS 16.0 or later and is compatible with iPhone and iPad devices supporting ARKit.
